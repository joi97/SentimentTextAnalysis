# Emojify - Sentiment Analysis of Text - Machine Learning Project

The aim of this work was to find the most related sentiment of a written sequence and map it into an emoji (this is a problem of # text classification). 
In this case there are only five emoji: heart, baseball, smile, disappointed, fork-andknife. 
Our project is divided into two main parts: In the first one we implement most of the model see during the course (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors) while in the second one we build a Neural Network, a Deep NN and also we implement a Long short-term memory (LSTM) NN because it can keep track of the dependencies between sequence elements. 
We decided to divide the project into these two parts because we use different working methods.
